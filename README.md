To properly use the soundbot, please create a "config.txt" file on your host and bind it to "/config.txt" in the docker. Paste the example config to your host config.txt from here: https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot/wiki/Example-Config

Don't forget to change the Token and Owner ID or the Bot won't work.
